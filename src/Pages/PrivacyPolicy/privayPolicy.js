          services to our customers. We may use this information for marketing
          campaigns in order to market products and services to you, unless you
          have asked us not to. We may also disclose your information to third

          Mobile marketing campaigns may involve you sending an e-mail from your

          other response will then be sent to your mobile device. Opting to
          participate in a campaign is solely your choice. When you engage in
          these mobile marketing campaigns, we and the third-party campaign
          operator may collect your mobile phone number, the name of your
          wireless service provider, images that you send using your mobile
          device as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.

        <p>HEALTH AND AGE INFORMATION</p>
        <p>
          When you register for membership on our Site, we also collect your
          basic health profile information when you actively give us such
          information. The health and age information we collect allows
          HarvesTrolley to evaluate your self-reported health status to
          determine basic program eligibility. You will be notified at
          registration if your profile excludes you from participation in the
          plan. HarvesTrolley will not disclose your health and age information
          (including self-reported height and weight) to third parties.

        <p>OTHER INFORMATION YOU MAY VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE</p>
        <p>
          From time to time, HarvesTrolley collects third-party email addresses
          or other contact information from our users and customers so that
          HarvesTrolley may send information to their friends and family on an
          as-requested basis. For example, HarvesTrolley collects email
          addresses when a customer provides us with that information so that we
          may send out Referral Coupons. We also require the same information
          when customers utilize certain functions such as “email this to a
          friend” features.

        <p>Information Provided Automatically</p>
        <p>WEB BEACONS, PIXEL TAGS, AND 3RD PARTY COOKIES</p>
        <p>
          HarvesTrolley, or third parties engaged by us, may use web beacons on
          some pages of this site. A web beacon (also known as a pixel tag or
          clear GIF) is a graphic image which is used to better understand the
          browsing patterns of visitors to the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the HTML code for the web beacon points to a site to retrieve the
          pixel image, information can be passed along, such as the IP address
          of the computer that requested the image, the time the web beacon was
          viewed and for how long, the type of browser that was used, and
          previously set cookie values. Web beacons DO NOT pass or read
          personally identifiable information about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies set by trusted third
          parties that are used to assess the effectiveness of particular
          promotional campaigns or to optimize advertising once a user leaves a
          website. View your browser’s help section to determine how to
          configure your browser to reject or manage first party (i.e.,
          HarvesTrolley) and/or third-party cookies. HarvesTrolley shares
          aggregated information collected through web beacons to vendors for
          which the beacon was set to determine the success of marketing
          campaigns, but does not disclose personally identifying information to
          these vendors.

        <p>What HarvesTrolley Does With Your Information</p>
        <p>HOW DOES HARVESTROLLEY PROTECT CUSTOMER INFORMATION?</p>
        <p>
          Protecting your information from unauthorized disclosure is extremely
          important to us. We use the industry standard technology to protect
          the security of your information. We have taken certain physical,
          electronic, contractual and managerial steps designed to safeguard the
          information we collect from you. Unfortunately, no data transaction
          over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The Site
          operator is not subject to the privacy and data security requirements
          of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) or Health Insurance Portability
          and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”).
        </p>
        <p>
          WILL HARVESTROLLEY DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO OUTSIDE
          PARTIES?
        </p>
        <p>
          HarvesTrolley shares information with third-party intermediaries for
          shipping and billing purposes and with other third-party
          intermediaries that provide a service for HarvesTrolley to help us
          operate our business, our Site, or administer activities on our
          behalf. These companies do not retain personal information or share it
          with any other parties. These companies may include Cybersource,
          United Parcel Service, Federal Express, Visa, Mastercard, Discover,
          American Express and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          HarvesTrolley may also provide aggregate statistics about our
          customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to
          reputable third-party vendors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, from time to time, we may make customer names, e-mail
          addresses, postal addresses, and transactional data available to third
          party marketing partners, such as through Data Cooperatives, whose
          products or services might be of value to you. Data Cooperatives use
          the information provided by participating marketers to provide more
          relevant marketing to consumers and reduce wasted marketing expenses.
          No individual transactional information is shared with the marketers,
          but rather it is used by the Data Cooperatives to provide services to
          the marketers who participate in the cooperative. We engage Data
          Cooperatives for the commercial purpose of better marketing to
          existing and prospective customers. You agree to the sharing of the
          above-described information with Data Cooperatives and third party
          marketers, and to be eligible to receive such materials when you sign
          up with us. If you do not want us to share your information with other
          companies, including Data Cooperatives, please let us know by emailing
          us at help@harvestrolley.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          HarvesTrolley may also disclose your personal information to third
          parties in certain limited circumstances, as follows (1) as necessary
          if we believe that there has been a violation of our Terms and
          Conditions, of the law, of our rights or of any third party; (2) to
          respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement
          agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to
          public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law;
          and (3) if you have given permission for us to share your account
          information with other members of your household.
        </p>
        <p>
          HarvesTrolley may also sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all
          of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in
          connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of
          assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity
          to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing
          of your information differs materially from that set forth in this
          Privacy Policy.

          it is on message boards, through e-mail, in meeting rooms, on social
          media pages or in blogs) your information can be collected and used by
          others. In short, if you post personal information online that is
          accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from
          other parties in return. We cannot control the actions of any third
          parties. We reserve the irrevocable, perpetual and worldwide right to

          engaged any comments, pictures or other information you post on the
          bulletin boards, social media pages, chat rooms, blogs, or elsewhere
          on the HarvesTrolley community website, without any further notice to
          you or any remuneration therefore.
